For running mmult_without_opt.c file using Intel VTune:
module load vtune/latest
gcc -o mmult_without_opt mmult_without_opt.c
vtune --collect=hotspot --result-dir=./report1 -- ./mmult_without_opt
cd report1
vtune-gui report1.vtune

For running mmult_with_opt.c file using Intel VTune:
module load vtune/latest
gcc -o mmult_with_opt mmult_with_opt.c
vtune --collect=hotspot --result-dir=./report2 -- ./mmult_with_opt
cd report2
vtune-gui report2.vtune


Intel VTune using shell script
v1
Below is the sample command to run hotspot analysis of an application with intel vtune:
vtune --collect=hotspot --result-dir=./report1 -- ./mmult_without_opt

Write a shell script to run any executable file with intel vtune. The shell script
should:
- load the required modules for running advisor (ask the user the name of the vtune module and load it using the module load command)
- ask the user for the absolute path to the project directory (it can be any name)
- ask the user for the absolute path to the executable file

Based on the input given by the user, the script should create and run the vtune command and generate the report

v2
Ask the user in the end if he/she wants to see top hotspots on the command line

v3
Check if the executable and project directory path exists or not on the system.

v4
Also, Open the generated report using vtune-gui command

v4
Give the user option to compare hotspots results of the file.
mmult_without_opt.c
mmult_with_opt.c

In the end, the script should compare hotspot result of both these files i.e. it should show increase/decrease in time of specific hotspot
